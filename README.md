# CPTR 345 Final Project
This is my (Ben Dronen) final project for CPTR 345. 

## Installation
- Ensure the latest version of Unreal Engine 4 is installed on your computer. Instructions for doing so can be found [here](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download).
- Install the appropriate driver for your VR headset. This project has been tested using an Oculus Quest 2. The driver for this can be found [here](https://www.oculus.com/setup/).
- Clone this repository with: ```git clone https://github.com/andrews-university-ecs/finalproject-dronenb```

## Usage
Open the finalproject-dronenb/FinalProject.uproject file, then when it opens in Unreal Engine, press "Play".
